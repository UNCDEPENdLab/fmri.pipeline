# Changelog

## fmri.pipeline 0.4-1

### Declarative FWE correction workflow

- Added a serializable
  [`fwe_spec()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/fwe_spec.md)
  API for describing level-3 FWE corrections with semantic
  model/contrast selectors, method options, correction masks, and
  scheduler settings. Specifications can be read from and written to
  YAML.

- Added pTFCE plan and execution support through
  [`plan_fwe_correction()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/plan_fwe_correction.md),
  [`run_fwe_plan()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/run_fwe_plan.md),
  and
  [`refresh_fwe_plan()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/refresh_fwe_plan.md).
  A single specification can fan out across all selected level-3
  z-statistic maps, with explicit preflight status for required inputs
  and optional dry-run command inspection.

- Added persistent FWE result snapshots and artifact manifests via
  [`collect_fwe_results()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/collect_fwe_results.md)
  and
  [`fwe_result_artifacts()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/fwe_result_artifacts.md),
  providing stable, semantically selectable output paths for downstream
  analyses.

### Bug fixes in `build_design_matrix` / `fmri.stimulus` convolution

- **Fix: overlapping events silently overwritten during stimulus
  construction.** `construct_stimulus` (inside `fmri.stimulus`) used
  assignment (`stim[idx] <- values[i]`) when building the microtime
  stimulus vector. When two events overlapped in time (e.g.,
  long-duration events with short ITIs), later events overwrote earlier
  ones, silently producing incorrect regressors. Fixed to use additive
  accumulation (`stim[idx] <- stim[idx] + values[i]`), which is correct
  by linearity of convolution. This affected all normalization modes
  (`none`, `durmax_1`, `evtmax_1`).

- **Fix: microtime bin truncation causing position-dependent convolution
  peaks.** Floating-point arithmetic in `fmri.stimulus` when converting
  onset times to microtime bins could produce values like `2013.999...`
  instead of `2014`, which R then truncated to the wrong bin. This
  shifted events by one microtime step, causing identical events at
  different run positions to have ~0.4% different peak amplitudes. Fixed
  by applying [`round()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html) to
  microtime onset and duration indices.

- **Optimized `evtmax_1` normalization.** Replaced the previous approach
  of N separate full-run FFT convolutions (one per event) with
  precomputed HRF peaks via small padded windows, followed by a single
  combined convolution. This also eliminates the previous fragile
  workaround for end-of-run events (re-convolving at the center of the
  run to estimate the “true” peak). Speedups of 2-9x depending on number
  of events, number of unique durations, and run length.

- Thread `microtime_resolution` parameter through `convolve_regressor`
  to ensure peak lookups and grid-phase computation always use the same
  resolution as the main convolution.

- **Fix: insufficient convolution padding with sub-second TRs.**
  `convolve_stimulus` used a fixed 20-TR padding for edge-effect
  suppression, which at TR=0.5s was only 10 seconds — not enough for the
  double-gamma HRF undershoot to decay (still ~-0.02 at 20s). Changed to
  30 seconds of absolute time padding regardless of TR, preventing
  circular convolution artifacts near run boundaries in multiband
  acquisitions.

### Repeated timing rows and within-trial occurrences

- Fixed L1 setup for occurrence-keyed signals when subject events are
  aggregated as a `data.table`. The occurrence validation added in July
  used data-frame column-selection syntax that `data.table` interpreted
  as a request for a literal `join_cols` column, causing every affected
  design build to fail and leaving an empty FSL setup table.

- [`run_feat_sepjobs()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/run_feat_sepjobs.md)
  now validates its FSL setup table before model filtering and reports a
  clear upstream-setup diagnostic instead of the misleading
  `object 'l1_model' not found` error.

- Pipeline inputs and time-series multipliers now copy incoming
  `data.table`s to ordinary `data.frame`s only when necessary. Fresh
  `rbindlist()` aggregations are likewise normalized at data-frame API
  boundaries without copying caller-owned objects or converting existing
  data.frames.

- [`mixed_by()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/mixed_by.md)
  and
  [`fill_atlas_with_stats()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/fill_atlas_with_stats.md)
  now isolate their internal `data.table` operations from caller-owned
  inputs. Keying, sorting, and conversion inside these functions no
  longer change an input object’s class, key, or row order by reference.

- `trial_data` now supports ragged timing rows: a row may contain
  trial-level timings alongside a within-trial occurrence, and sparse
  onset columns use `NA` to indicate no occurrence on that row. Trial
  identifiers may be `NA` for free-running occurrences.

- Exact duplicate timing/value records are collapsed before convolution
  to prevent copied trial rows from inflating regressors. Set
  `keep_duplicate_occurrences: true` on a YAML signal to retain them.

- Parametric modulators and within-subject factors now align to an
  internal timing-occurrence key, rather than `run_number + trial`, so
  repeated trials do not create many-to-many joins. Modulator values
  must be present on each modeled timing row; missing values omit that
  occurrence.

- Beta-series signals now require exactly one distinct timing occurrence
  per trial after duplicate collapse and reject missing trial
  identifiers or ambiguous multi-occurrence trials.

- Removed unused `subtrial` classes, mappings, arguments, and
  documentation.

### Backend system overhaul

- Per-level and per-model backend selection via `gpa$level_backends`,
  `execution_backend`, and `producer_backend` fields
- Artifact-based dependency resolution: backends now declare which
  artifacts they produce and require, and the pipeline validates these
  at submission time
- Preflight report logged at pipeline start showing resolved backends,
  producer mappings, and artifact satisfaction for each analysis level
- [`harvest_l3_inputs()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/harvest_l3_inputs.md)
  replaces the former
  [`harvest_fsl_copes()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/harvest_fsl_copes.md)
  with a dispatcher that routes to backend-specific harvesters based on
  the declared `producer_backend`
- Run-time backend overrides via `level_backends` and
  `backend_overrides` arguments to
  [`run_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/run_glm_pipeline.md)

### FSL/FLAME backend reliability

- **Fix: FSL L3 jobs now wait on the backend-specific L2 producer job.**
  FSL L3 setup/run jobs now depend on `setup_run_l2_fsl` when they
  consume FSL L2 outputs, avoiding races where L3 setup could start
  before the FSL L2 cache and FEAT outputs were ready.

- **Improved slice-parallel FLAME1+2 recovery.** The local
  `flame_runner` keeps FSL’s default z-slice FLAME parallelization, but
  no longer fails the full model immediately when one FLAME12 slice
  crashes. Failed `--runmode=flame12` slice commands are retried as
  `--runmode=flame1`, with FLAME12-only MCMC options removed from the
  retry command.

- **Surfaced FLAME12 slice fallbacks in logs.** When a slice is
  recovered by FLAME1, the failed FLAME12 slice log directory is moved
  aside as `statsNNNN.flame12_failed.*`, and the FEAT directory receives
  a `flame_runner_fallbacks.tsv` audit file. These records are also
  promoted into the level-specific `lgr` model-estimation logs
  (`logs/l1_estimation.*`, `logs/l2_estimation.*`, or
  `logs/l3_estimation.*`) as warnings so users can see that estimation
  recovered by falling back to FLAME1 for one or more slices.

### Level 1 setup refactor

- Refactor `setup_l1_models` into smaller helper functions
  (`setup_l1_subject`, `load_cached_l1_bdm`, `drop_runs_without_events`)
- Improved `build_design_matrix` error messages for missing
  onset/duration columns and empty event tables

### Other improvements

- Support for SPM-style concatenated run handling at Level 1
- AFNI `3dLMEr` Level 3 execution backend with automatic `-qVars`
  detection and `dataTable.txt` generation
- Backend specification defaults (`default_glm_backend_specs`) for FSL,
  SPM, and AFNI
- [`lookup_feat_outputs()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/lookup_feat_outputs.md)
  now returns stable, level-specific `$l1`, `$l2`, and `$l3` tables by
  default, with an explicit `format = "long"` option. L2 passthroughs
  are represented as logical L2 rows and identify their L1
  materialization and source image.
