# function to get interpolated event locked data

function to get interpolated event locked data

## Usage

``` r
event_lock_ts(
  fmri_obj,
  event = NULL,
  time_before = -3,
  time_after = 3,
  collide_before = NULL,
  collide_after = NULL,
  pad_before = -1,
  pad_after = 1,
  time_audit = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- fmri_obj:

  An fmri_ts object containing time series data that are optionally
  keyed on one or more grouping variables (e.g., ROI). The fmri_obj must
  also contain trial-level data (in the \$event_data field) for
  event-locking to proceed.

- event:

  Name of column in `fmri_obj$event_data` that identifies onset for
  event of interest

- time_before:

  How many seconds before the `event` do we want data. Default: -3

- time_after:

  How many seconds after the `event` do we want data. Default: 3

- collide_before:

  An optional vector of column names in `trial_df` that set a boundary
  on the earliest time point used in interpolation. This effectively
  truncates the time series for interpolation to a smaller window than
  specified by `time_before`.

- collide_after:

  An optional vector of column names in `trial_df` that set a boundary
  on the latest time point used in interpolation. This effectively
  truncates the time series for interpolation to a smaller window than
  specified by `time_after`.

- pad_before:

  Number of seconds to include in the epoch time window before the event
  of interest. Interpolation spans the window from `time_before` to
  `time_after`, but padding includes data points at the boundary that
  can help to have sufficient data to interpolate early and late times
  within the epoch.

- pad_after:

  Number of seconds to include in the epoch time window after the event
  of interest.

- time_audit:

  If TRUE, additional columns will be added to the output showing how
  alignment is calculated vis-a-vis event timing

- logfile:

  Name of log file containing event-locking problems
