# Regularized linear deconvolution of BOLD time series

Estimate a continuous latent activity time series by solving a
regularized inverse convolution problem for one or more BOLD signals.

## Usage

``` r
deconvolve_reglin(
  BOLDobs,
  kernel,
  lambda = NULL,
  lambda_grid = 10^seq(-4, 2, length.out = 20),
  penalty = c("diff2", "diff1", "ridge"),
  kernel_grid = NULL,
  hrf_lags = 0L,
  tune_by = c("global", "signal"),
  normalize = TRUE,
  demean = TRUE,
  trim_kernel = TRUE,
  ridge_floor = 1e-08,
  return_diagnostics = FALSE,
  prewhiten_gcv = FALSE,
  prewhiten_rho = NULL,
  backend = c("cpp", "r", "wiener"),
  wiener_shrinkage = c("scalar", "psd"),
  wiener_psd_smooth = 7L,
  wiener_psd_floor = 1e-08,
  gcv_rule = c("min", "1se")
)
```

## Arguments

- BOLDobs:

  matrix of observed BOLD time series (n_timepoints x n_signals) or a
  numeric vector.

- kernel:

  assumed HRF kernel. A vector or single-column matrix.

- lambda:

  regularization strength. If `NULL`, chosen from `lambda_grid` by
  generalized cross-validation.

- lambda_grid:

  candidate regularization strengths used when `lambda` is `NULL`.

- penalty:

  regularization penalty: `"diff2"` for smooth curvature, `"diff1"` for
  smooth first differences, or `"ridge"` for simple amplitude shrinkage.

- kernel_grid:

  optional list or matrix of candidate HRF kernels. If supplied,
  `kernel` and `hrf_lags` are ignored for tuning.

- hrf_lags:

  integer shifts, in TR bins, applied to `kernel`. Negative values make
  the candidate HRF peak earlier; positive values make it later.

- tune_by:

  whether to tune `lambda`/HRF globally across all signals or
  independently for each signal.

- normalize:

  whether to z-score `BOLDobs` before deconvolution. Default: `TRUE`.

- demean:

  whether to subtract column means before deconvolution. Ignored when
  `normalize = TRUE`, because z-scoring already demeans.

- trim_kernel:

  whether to remove the initial `length(kernel) - 1` latent samples,
  corresponding to pre-observation HRF support.

- ridge_floor:

  small diagonal ridge added for numerical stability.

- return_diagnostics:

  whether to return a list containing diagnostics rather than only the
  deconvolved matrix.

- prewhiten_gcv:

  whether to estimate AR(1) autocorrelation and use a prewhitened
  objective for lambda/HRF selection and deconvolution.

- prewhiten_rho:

  optional AR(1) coefficient used when `prewhiten_gcv = TRUE`. If
  `NULL`, a pooled median AR(1) coefficient is estimated from first-pass
  reconstruction residuals.

- backend:

  implementation backend. `"cpp"` uses the RcppArmadillo regularized
  inverse implementation; `"r"` uses the reference R implementation;
  `"wiener"` uses a frequency-domain Wiener-style deconvolution for
  comparison.

- wiener_shrinkage:

  shrinkage strategy for `backend = "wiener"`. `"scalar"` uses
  `Conj(H) / (|H|^2 + lambda)`. `"psd"` estimates smoothed signal and
  residual noise spectra from a scalar Wiener first pass, then uses
  frequency-dependent shrinkage.

- wiener_psd_smooth:

  odd integer smoothing width for the estimated signal/noise spectra in
  `wiener_shrinkage = "psd"`.

- wiener_psd_floor:

  lower bound for estimated spectra.

- gcv_rule:

  lambda/HRF selection rule. `"min"` selects the minimum mean GCV
  candidate. `"1se"` selects the largest lambda whose mean GCV is within
  one standard error of the minimum. The standard error is computed
  across signal columns for `tune_by = "global"`.

## Value

A matrix of deconvolved time series, or a list with `activity` and
tuning diagnostics when `return_diagnostics = TRUE`.
