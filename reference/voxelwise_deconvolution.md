# Function to perform voxelwise deconvolution on an fMRI dataset using the fMRI model arguments object

Function to perform voxelwise deconvolution on an fMRI dataset using the
fMRI model arguments object

## Usage

``` r
voxelwise_deconvolution(
  niftis,
  add_metadata = NULL,
  out_dir = getwd(),
  out_file_expression = NULL,
  log_file = file.path(out_dir, "deconvolve_errors"),
  TR = NULL,
  time_offset = 0,
  atlas_files = NULL,
  mask = NULL,
  nprocs = 20,
  save_original_ts = TRUE,
  algorithm = "bush2011",
  decon_settings = list(nev_lr = 0.01, epsilon = 0.005, beta = 60, kernel =
    spm_hrf(TR)$hrf, n_resample = 25),
  afni_dir = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- niftis:

  A vector of processed fMRI timeseries images (4D files) to be
  deconvolved

- add_metadata:

  A data.frame with one row per value of `niftis`. Columns of this
  data.frame are added to the output file for identification.

- out_dir:

  Base output directory for deconvolved time series files. Default is
  [`getwd()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/getwd.html).

- out_file_expression:

  Expression evaluated to resolve the filename for the deconvolved csv
  files. Default is to convert the `niftis` value for a given subject
  into a filename by replacing slashes with periods and adding the atlas
  image name. Note that the suffix `_deconvolved.csv.gz` or
  `_original.csv.gz` will be added to the expression, so don't pass this
  piece.

- log_file:

  Name (and path) of log file for any deconvolution errors or messages

- TR:

  the repetition time of the sequence in seconds. Required

- time_offset:

  The number of seconds that will be subtracted or added to the time
  field. Default: 0. Useful if some number of volumes have been dropped
  from the NIfTI data prior to deconvolution.

- atlas_files:

  optional atlas file vector specifying voxels used in deconvolution. If
  omitted, perform whole-brain deconvolution

- mask:

  an optional character string specifying a mask that should be used to
  constrain bounds of deconvolution.

- nprocs:

  The number of processors to use simultaneously for deconvolution

- save_original_ts:

  Whether to save the voxelwise BOLD data prior to deconvolution (for
  comparison/diagnosis). Default: TRUE

- algorithm:

  Which deconvolution algorithm to use for deconvolving voxelwise time
  series. Default: "bush2011". Alternative is "bush2015", which
  implements a resampling approach as well, or
  "reglin"/"regularized_linear", which estimates a continuous latent
  activity time series using regularized linear deconvolution with
  optional HRF tuning.

- decon_settings:

  A list of settings passed to the deconvolution algorithm. If you have
  a compiled deconvolvefilter binary, pass it as `bush2011_binary`,
  which will be used in deconvolution.

- afni_dir:

  Full path to directory containing AFNI binaries (this function uses
  3dMaskdump).

## Value

Nothing (invisible NULL).

## Details

The Bush 2011 algorithm is implemented in a compiled binary called
deconvolvefilter
(https://github.com/UNCDEPENdLab/deconvolution-filtering) that is much
faster than the pure R (or original MATLAB) version. We recommend using
this for whole-brain deconvolution. The package includes a binary for
the Linux x86_64 architecture.

If you want to use subject metadata to name the output file, use
`this_subj` in your `out_file_expression`, which will give you access to
a one-row data.frame containing the metadata for the current subject in
the loop.

## Examples

``` r
  if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

    #name outputs according to subject metadata
    xx <- voxelwise_deconvolution(
      niftis="/proj/mnhallqlab/user/michael/test_nifti.nii.gz",
      out_dir="/proj/mnhallqlab/user/michael/decon_outputs",
      out_file_expression=expression(paste0(this_subj$subid, "_run", this_subj$run_num, "_", atlas_img_name))
    )
  } # }
```
