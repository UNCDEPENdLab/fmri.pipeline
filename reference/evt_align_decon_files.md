# Align a set of deconvolved time series files to an event of interest function.

Align a set of deconvolved time series files to an event of interest
function.

## Usage

``` r
evt_align_decon_files(
  d_files,
  trial_df,
  alignment = list(),
  aggregate_by = "atlas_value",
  tr = NULL,
  atlas_cuts = NULL,
  atlas_subset = NULL,
  out_file = NULL,
  ncpus = 8,
  time_audit = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- d_files:

  A vector of deconvolved .csv.gz files created by
  `voxelwise_deconvolution`.

- trial_df:

  The trial-level data.frame containing id and run for each subject
  represented in `d_files`.

- alignment:

  A list containing alignment details passed to
  get_medusa_interpolated_ts

- aggregate_by:

  The column name in the individual deconvolved files used for averaging
  repeated units (e.g., voxels) into single event-aligned time series.
  Most commonly, this is "atlas_value", which will lead to averaging of
  voxels within each parcel in the mask.

- tr:

  The repetition time of the sequence in seconds.

- atlas_cuts:

  For a continuous-valued atlas (e.g., containing a gradient of
  interest), a vector of cut points for binning values. These cuts are
  applied to the `aggregate_by` column, commonly "atlas_value"

- atlas_subset:

  An optional numeric vector containing values of `aggregate_by`

- out_file:

  The output file name (can include path) for the event-aligned csv
  file. If NULL, nothing is output (but the event-aligned data are
  always returned as a data.frame)

- ncpus:

  Number of local worker processes to use.

- time_audit:

  If TRUE, additional columns will be added to the output showing how
  alignment is calculated vis-a-vis event timing

## Details

This is intended to be used internally by `run_decon_alignment`, which
accepts a set of mask/atlas files and alignments, then processes these
in parallel.
