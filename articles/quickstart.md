# fmri.pipeline quick start guide

## Purpose

`fmri.pipeline` is an R package for setting up, submitting, and tracking
fMRI GLM analyses on HPC systems. The package is built around a single
analysis object, usually called `gpa`, that stores the input data, model
specifications, output locations, compute settings, and job-tracking
state for one task analysis.

The most mature end-to-end backend is FSL FEAT/FLAME. Current pipeline
engineering also supports backend selection, including hybrid workflows
such as FSL at Levels 1-2 and AFNI `3dLMEr` at Level 3 for longitudinal
models. The backend system performs a preflight check before submission
so that model/back-end combinations and upstream artifact requirements
are resolved before jobs are launched.

This guide is meant to get a new user from input tables to a submitted
pipeline run. More detailed conceptual material is in
[`vignette("design")`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/articles/design.md),
longitudinal guidance is in
[`vignette("longitudinal")`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/articles/longitudinal.md),
and run diagnosis is in
[`vignette("diagnosis")`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/articles/diagnosis.md).

## Model Combinations

The pipeline treats Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 model sets as a grid
of model combinations. For example, suppose you define:

- two Level 1 models: one with a prediction-error modulator and one with
  only event onsets
- two Level 2 models: one run-average model and one model with a
  run-level condition predictor
- two Level 3 models: one intercept-only group model and one model with
  age as a covariate

If you run all of them, `fmri.pipeline` will set up and estimate all
eight combinations: 2 Level 1 x 2 Level 2 x 2 Level 3. This is useful
for systematic model comparison, but it can also create many jobs
quickly. Start with one model at each level, verify that the pipeline
runs cleanly, and then add additional model variants.

## Analysis Levels

`fmri.pipeline` uses a fixed three-level vocabulary:

- **Level 1**: Run-level time-series GLM. Events and parametric
  modulators are convolved with the HRF and estimated separately for
  each run.
- **Level 2**: Within-subject run combination. Multiple Level 1 COPEs
  are combined within a subject or subject-session.
- **Level 3**: Sample-level or group-level model. Subject/session maps
  are modeled across participants.

For a single-run task, there is no standalone Level 2 run-combination
step. The pipeline still calls the group model Level 3 so the
nomenclature is stable across single-run and multi-run analyses.

## Input Tables

The preferred setup is to provide three long-form data frames:
`trial_data`, `run_data`, and `subject_data`.
[`setup_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/setup_glm_pipeline.md)
can derive `run_data` and `subject_data` from `trial_data` when needed,
but explicit tables are easier to audit and usually clearer for new
analyses. Do not provide a separate `session_data` table; the GPA object
constructs that internal table from `run_data` and `subject_data`.

### Required Identifiers

All input tables must contain an `id` column. `session` is recommended
and is required for longitudinal studies; if missing, the pipeline adds
`session = 1`. Trial- and run-level data should contain `run_number`; if
missing, the pipeline adds `run_number = 1`.

The default identifier names are:

| Concept                           | Default column |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| Subject identifier                | `id`           |
| Session or visit                  | `session`      |
| Run number within subject/session | `run_number`   |
| Trial number within run           | `trial`        |
| Run NIfTI path                    | `run_nifti`    |
| Run data directory                | `mr_dir`       |

If your data use different names, pass a named `vm` vector to
[`setup_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/setup_glm_pipeline.md):

``` r

gpa <- setup_glm_pipeline(
  analysis_name = "memory_task",
  trial_data = trial_df,
  run_data = run_df,
  subject_data = subject_df,
  tr = 0.9,
  vm = c(
    id = "participant_id",
    session = "visit",
    run_number = "run",
    trial = "trial_index",
    run_nifti = "bold_file"
  )
)
```

After validation, the pipeline converts these names to its internal
conventions, so downstream examples in this guide use `id`, `session`,
and `run_number`.

### Trial Data

`trial_data` has one row per trial per run. It provides the event timing
and trial-varying variables used to build Level 1 regressors.

Typical columns include:

- `id`, `session`, `run_number`, and `trial`
- onset columns, in seconds from the start of the run, such as
  `cue_onset` or `feedback_onset`
- duration columns, in seconds, such as `cue_duration` or
  `feedback_duration`
- intertrial/interstimulus interval columns used by truncation logic or
  model specification
- parametric modulators, such as prediction error, reaction time, value,
  or uncertainty
- within-run condition factors, such as `condition` or `feedback_type`

Example:

``` r

trial_df <- tibble::tibble(
  id = c("10637", "10637", "10637"),
  session = 1,
  run_number = 1,
  trial = 1:3,
  cue_onset = c(8.07, 15.20, 19.73),
  cue_duration = c(1.05, 2.45, 2.25),
  feedback_onset = c(9.19, 17.72, 22.05),
  feedback_duration = 0.9,
  iti_duration = c(5.1, 1.1, 2.1),
  condition = c("fear", "fear", "happy"),
  prediction_error = c(26.28, 54.05, 33.34)
)
```

Onsets and durations should be in seconds. If an event has a constant
duration, you can either include a constant duration column or specify
the fixed duration in the model specification.

### Run Data

`run_data` has one row per fMRI acquisition. It connects the task design
to the preprocessed BOLD files and any run-level covariates.

The most robust approach is to provide `run_nifti` directly. If
`run_nifti` is absent, the pipeline can search under
`subject_data$mr_dir` using `fmri_file_regex`, `fmri_path_regex`, and
`run_number_regex`, but explicit paths are easier to debug.

Typical columns include:

- `id`, `session`, and `run_number`
- `run_nifti`, the path to the preprocessed 4D NIfTI for that run
- `confound_input_file`, the path to a confound TSV/TXT file, often from
  fMRIPrep or postprocessing
- `tr`, only when TR varies across runs
- run-level predictors for Level 2 models, such as `condition`,
  `difficulty`, or `scanner`

Example:

``` r

run_df <- tibble::tibble(
  id = c("10637", "10637"),
  session = 1,
  run_number = c(1, 2),
  condition = c("fear", "happy"),
  run_nifti = c(
    "/proj/lab/derivatives/sub-10637/func/sub-10637_task-clock_run-1_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz",
    "/proj/lab/derivatives/sub-10637/func/sub-10637_task-clock_run-2_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz"
  ),
  confound_input_file = c(
    "/proj/lab/derivatives/sub-10637/func/sub-10637_task-clock_run-1_desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv",
    "/proj/lab/derivatives/sub-10637/func/sub-10637_task-clock_run-2_desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv"
  )
)
```

### Subject Data

`subject_data` provides Level 3 covariates and subject/session metadata.
In cross-sectional analyses, it is usually one row per subject. In
longitudinal analyses, it must be one row per subject-session (`id` +
`session`).

Typical columns include:

- `id` and `session`
- group indicators, demographics, clinical variables, or behavioral
  scores
- session-level variables for longitudinal analyses, such as visit label
  or days since baseline

Example:

``` r

subject_df <- tibble::tibble(
  id = c("10637", "10638", "10711"),
  session = 1,
  age = c(16.70, 16.21, 18.32),
  sex = c("M", "M", "F"),
  group = c("control", "control", "patient")
)
```

For longitudinal designs, store one row per `id` and `session`, not one
row per subject:

``` r

subject_df <- tibble::tibble(
  id = c("10637", "10637", "10638", "10638"),
  session = c(1, 2, 1, 2),
  session_label = c("baseline", "followup", "baseline", "followup"),
  days_since_baseline = c(0, 365, 0, 391),
  age_baseline = c(16.70, 16.70, 16.21, 16.21)
)
```

Person-level covariates such as baseline age, sex, or randomized group
should be repeated across that subject’s sessions. The pipeline derives
`gpa$session_data` internally from columns in `run_data` that are
constant within `id`/`session`, then merges those with the
subject-session rows from `subject_data`.

### BIDS Helpers

If your derivatives are close to BIDS/fMRIPrep layout, helper functions
can create starter tables:

``` r

run_df <- generate_run_data_from_bids(
  bids_dir = "/proj/lab/derivatives/fmriprep",
  task_name = "clock",
  desc = "preproc",
  suffix = "bold",
  space = "MNI152NLin2009cAsym"
)

subject_df <- generate_subject_data_from_bids(
  bids_dir = "/proj/lab/derivatives/fmriprep"
)

trial_df <- generate_trial_data_from_bids(
  bids_dir = "/proj/lab/derivatives/fmriprep",
  task_name = "clock"
)
```

Treat these as a starting point. Always inspect the result and join in
any analysis-specific task variables before running the pipeline.

## Create the `gpa` Object

[`setup_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/setup_glm_pipeline.md)
validates inputs, normalizes column names, sets output locations,
records scheduler and compute settings, and stores model specifications.
If models are not available yet, pass `NULL` and build them afterward.

``` r

library(fmri.pipeline)
library(dplyr)

trial_df <- readr::read_csv("inputs/clock_trials.csv")
run_df <- readr::read_csv("inputs/clock_runs.csv")
subject_df <- readr::read_csv("inputs/clock_subjects.csv")

gpa <- setup_glm_pipeline(
  analysis_name = "clock_glm_2026_05_11",
  scheduler = "slurm",
  output_directory = "/proj/lab/analysis/clock",
  trial_data = trial_df,
  run_data = run_df,
  subject_data = subject_df,
  tr = 0.9,
  drop_volumes = 2,
  n_expected_runs = 2,
  l1_models = NULL,
  l2_models = NULL,
  l3_models = NULL,
  glm_software = "fsl",
  confound_settings = list(
    confound_input_colnames = NULL,
    l1_confound_regressors = c(
      "csf", "csf_derivative1",
      "white_matter", "white_matter_derivative1"
    ),
    na_strings = c("NA", "n/a", ""),
    spike_volumes = "framewise_displacement > 0.9",
    exclude_run = "max(framewise_displacement, na.rm = TRUE) > 5 || mean(framewise_displacement > 0.9, na.rm = TRUE) > 0.10",
    exclude_subject = "n_good_runs < 1",
    truncate_run = "(framewise_displacement > 0.9 & time > last_offset) | (time > last_offset + last_isi)"
  ),
  parallel = list(
    l1_setup_cores = 4L,
    pipeline_cores = "default",
    finalize_time = "2:00:00",
    fsl = list(
      l1_feat_alljobs_time = "72:00:00",
      l2_feat_time = "4:00:00",
      l3_feat_time = "24:00:00"
    )
  ),
  lgr_threshold = "info"
)
```

Key setup arguments:

- `analysis_name`: a stable name for this analysis. If
  `output_directory` does not already end with this name, the pipeline
  appends it.
- `scheduler`: `"slurm"`, `"torque"`, or `"local"`. Use `"local"` only
  for small tests.
- `tr`: repetition time in seconds. If TR differs by run, provide a `tr`
  column in `run_data` instead.
- `drop_volumes`: number of leading volumes to remove from
  timing/confound alignment.
- `n_expected_runs`: used for warnings and subject/run completeness
  checks.
- `confound_settings`: tells the pipeline which nuisance regressors to
  include, which volumes to spike, and how to exclude or truncate runs.
- `parallel`: controls setup cores and scheduler time/memory settings.

The confound expressions are evaluated in run-level confound data after
motion regressors and `framewise_displacement` have been prepared.
Expressions can refer to confound columns plus helper variables such as
`time`, `volume`, `last_onset`, `last_offset`, and `last_isi`.

## Define Models

Models can be built interactively or read from YAML/JSON. For
reproducible analysis, the recommended workflow is:

1.  Build a model interactively once, if useful.
2.  Export it with
    [`export_glm_config()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/export_glm_config.md).
3.  Edit the YAML into a project-owned specification.
4.  Rebuild future `gpa` objects from that specification.

### Interactive Model Builder

``` r

gpa <- build_l1_models(gpa)
gpa <- build_l2_models(gpa)
gpa <- build_l3_models(gpa)

export_glm_config(gpa, file = "clock_glm_spec.yaml")
```

You can also ask
[`setup_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/setup_glm_pipeline.md)
to prompt immediately by using `l1_models = "prompt"`,
`l2_models = "prompt"`, or `l3_models = "prompt"`.

### YAML Model Specification

The same YAML file can contain L1, L2, and L3 model definitions:

``` r

gpa <- build_l1_models(gpa, from_spec_file = "clock_glm_spec.yaml")
gpa <- build_l2_models(gpa, from_spec_file = "clock_glm_spec.yaml")
gpa <- build_l3_models(gpa, from_spec_file = "clock_glm_spec.yaml")
```

This compact example defines two events, two unit-height signals, one
parametric signal, a run-average Level 2 model, and an intercept-only
Level 3 model:

``` yaml
onsets:
  - cue_onset
  - feedback_onset

durations:
  - cue_duration
  - feedback_duration

isis:
  - iti_duration

values:
  - prediction_error

wi_factors:
  - condition

events:
  cue:
    onset: cue_onset
    duration: cue_duration
    isi: iti_duration

  feedback:
    onset: feedback_onset
    duration: feedback_duration
    isi: iti_duration

signals:
  cue:
    event: cue
    value_fixed: 1
    normalization: none

  feedback:
    event: feedback
    value_fixed: 1
    normalization: none

  pe_feedback:
    event: feedback
    parametric_modulator: prediction_error
    normalization: evtmax_1

l1_models:
  task:
    signals:
      - cue
      - feedback
      - pe_feedback
    contrasts:
      diagonal: yes

l2_models:
  run_average:
    level: 2
    model_formula: ~ 1
    l2_scope: id_session
    contrasts:
      diagonal: yes
      overall_response: yes

l3_models:
  group_mean:
    level: 3
    model_formula: ~ 1
    l3_input_mode: per_session
    contrasts:
      diagonal: yes
      overall_response: yes
    fsl_outlier_deweighting: no
```

Model concepts:

- **Events** define when something happened: onset, duration, and
  optional ISI/ITI.
- **Signals** define regressors to estimate: an event plus
  amplitude/modulation and HRF normalization.
- **Parametric modulators** are continuous signal amplitudes. By
  default, design-matrix generation centers these values
  (`additional$bdm_args$center_values = TRUE`), which makes unit-height
  event regressors and parametric effects easier to interpret together.
- **L1 models** choose which signals enter the run-level GLM and which
  L1 contrasts are created.
- **L2 models** combine runs within subject or subject-session. Use
  `l2_scope: id_session` for ordinary within-session run combination and
  most longitudinal workflows. Use `l2_scope: id` only when pooling
  sessions inside subject is scientifically intended.
- **L3 models** define group inference. For multi-session data,
  `l3_input_mode` controls how session-level maps feed Level 3.
- **Contrasts** under `contrasts:` control diagonal COPEs, condition
  means, pairwise differences, cell means, and overall responses.
  Keeping contrast settings nested under `contrasts:` matches exported
  configs.

This guide shows minimal contrast settings. For a full explanation of
diagonal contrasts, condition means, pairwise differences, cell means,
overall response, simple slopes, emmeans weighting, and custom contrast
entry, see
[`vignette("interactive-model-builder")`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/articles/interactive-model-builder.md).

For categorical predictors at Level 2 or Level 3, include reference
levels when interpretation matters:

``` yaml
l3_models:
  group_by_age:
    level: 3
    model_formula: ~ group + age
    reference_level:
      group: control
    covariate_transform:
      age: mean
    contrasts:
      diagonal: yes
      cond_means: group
      pairwise_diffs: group
      overall_response: yes
    fsl_outlier_deweighting: no
```

`covariate_transform: age: mean` mean-centers `age` for model
construction. Centering continuous covariates usually makes the
intercept and condition means easier to interpret.

## Backend Selection

For a standard FSL analysis, no special backend configuration is needed:

``` r

gpa$glm_software <- "fsl"
```

For different software at different levels, use `gpa$level_backends`:

``` r

gpa$glm_software <- "fsl"
gpa$level_backends <- list(
  l1 = "fsl",
  l2 = "fsl",
  l3 = "afni"
)
```

For model-specific control, set backend fields on the model object or in
YAML. This is the current recommended pattern for AFNI `3dLMEr` Level 3
models that consume FSL-produced Level 2 inputs:

``` yaml
l2_models:
  session_average:
    level: 2
    model_formula: ~ 1
    l2_scope: id_session
    contrasts:
      diagonal: yes
      overall_response: yes

l3_models:
  longitudinal_lmer:
    level: 3
    model_formula: ~ session_label
    l3_input_mode: 3dlmer
    execution_backend: afni
    producer_backend: fsl
    random_effects: "(1 | Subj)"
    contrasts:
      cond_means: session_label
      pairwise_diffs: session_label
      overall_response: yes
```

Current limitations are important:

- FSL supports separate Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 execution.
- SPM support uses SPM-style run/session handling and does not run a
  standalone Level 2 FEAT-style step.
- AFNI `3dLMEr` is currently supported as a Level 3 execution backend.
- Level 3 producer inputs are currently implemented only for FSL. In
  practice, AFNI Level 3 should usually specify `producer_backend: fsl`.

When
[`run_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/run_glm_pipeline.md)
starts, it resolves backend selection, validates producer requirements,
and logs a backend preflight report. If you see a backend or producer
error, read that report first.

## Run the Pipeline

Submit the full selected analysis with:

``` r

run_glm_pipeline(gpa)
```

By default,
[`run_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/run_glm_pipeline.md)
prompts you to choose L1, L2, and L3 models. For scripted runs, pass
model names explicitly:

``` r

run_glm_pipeline(
  gpa,
  l1_model_names = "task",
  l2_model_names = "run_average",
  l3_model_names = "group_mean"
)
```

You can also apply temporary backend overrides at run time:

``` r

run_glm_pipeline(
  gpa,
  l1_model_names = "task",
  l2_model_names = "session_average",
  l3_model_names = "longitudinal_lmer",
  level_backends = list(l3 = "afni")
)
```

The submitted job sequence is usually:

1.  `finalize_configuration`: checks the compute environment, validates
    models, initializes the SQLite tracker, looks up NIfTI metadata, and
    finalizes defaults.
2.  `setup_l1`: creates Level 1 design matrices, timing files, and
    backend-specific setup files such as FSL `.fsf` files.
3.  `run_l1_<backend>`: submits and waits for run-level model jobs.
4.  `setup_run_l2_<backend>`: sets up and runs Level 2 jobs when a
    standalone Level 2 step is needed.
5.  `setup_run_l3_<backend>`: sets up and runs Level 3 jobs.
6.  `cleanup_glm`: refreshes status tables and reconciles
    backend-specific caches.

The exact steps depend on selected models, whether the task is
single-run or multi-run, and which backends are requested.

## Output Layout

Each analysis has a top-level output directory, usually:

``` text
<output_directory>/<analysis_name>/
```

Important contents include:

``` text
feat_l1/                 # FSL Level 1 setup files and .feat outputs
feat_l2/                 # FSL Level 2 .fsf files and .gfeat outputs
feat_l3/                 # FSL Level 3 .fsf files and .gfeat outputs
afni_3dlmer/             # AFNI 3dLMEr scripts and outputs, when AFNI is used
logs/                    # text and JSON logs from setup functions
scheduler_scripts/       # one batch_<uuid>/ directory per run_glm_pipeline() call
project_config.json      # analysis metadata and batch history
*.sqlite                 # SQLite job-tracking database
```

Default FEAT paths include model and contrast labels to avoid
collisions:

``` text
feat_l1/sub-<id>/ses-<session>/<l1_model>/FEAT_LVL1_run<run_number>.feat
feat_l2/sub-<id>/ses-<session>/L1m-<l1_model>/l1c-<l1_cope_label>/L2m-<l2_model>.gfeat
feat_l3/L3m-<l3_model>/L1m-<l1_model>/L2m-<l2_model>/l2c-<l2_contrast>/FEAT_l1c-<l1_contrast>.gfeat
```

The output templates are stored in `gpa$output_locations` and use `glue`
syntax. Advanced users can override them before running the pipeline,
but new users should start with the defaults.

## Check Status

The easiest interactive route is:

``` r

diagnose_pipeline(gpa)
```

For scripted checks, inspect the latest batch directory and SQLite job
tracker.

``` r

batch_dirs <- list.dirs(
  gpa$output_locations$scheduler_scripts,
  recursive = FALSE,
  full.names = TRUE
)
latest_batch <- batch_dirs[which.max(file.info(batch_dirs)$mtime)]
latest_batch
```

Load the run cache to inspect model status:

``` r

load(file.path(latest_batch, "run_pipeline_cache.RData"))

if (!is.null(gpa$l1_model_setup$fsl)) {
  gpa$l1_model_setup$fsl |>
    dplyr::count(feat_complete, feat_failed, to_run)
}

if (!is.null(gpa$l2_model_setup$fsl)) {
  gpa$l2_model_setup$fsl |>
    dplyr::filter(feat_failed | !feat_complete) |>
    dplyr::select(id, session, l1_model, l1_cope_name, l2_model, feat_dir, feat_fsf)
}

if (!is.null(gpa$l3_model_setup$fsl)) {
  gpa$l3_model_setup$fsl |>
    dplyr::filter(feat_failed | !feat_complete) |>
    dplyr::select(l1_model, l2_model, l3_model, feat_dir, feat_fsf)
}

if (!is.null(gpa$l3_model_setup$afni)) {
  gpa$l3_model_setup$afni |>
    dplyr::filter(afni_failed | !afni_complete) |>
    dplyr::select(l3_model, l1_cope_name, l2_cope_name, output_file, afni_script)
}
```

Backend-specific caches, such as `run_pipeline_cache_fsl.RData` or
`run_pipeline_cache_afni.RData`, can be more informative because they
are saved immediately after backend-specific jobs finish:

``` r

load(file.path(latest_batch, "run_pipeline_cache_fsl.RData"))
gpa$l2_model_setup$fsl |>
  dplyr::filter(feat_failed | !feat_complete)
```

On SLURM, scheduler exit codes are often the fastest way to distinguish
model errors from time or memory kills:

``` bash
sacct -j 49616891,49616892 --format=JobID,JobName%45,State,ExitCode,Elapsed,MaxRSS
```

For FSL outputs, successful artifacts should contain `.feat_complete`
and should not contain `.feat_fail`. Current pipeline runs also write
`job_manifest.tsv` into artifact directories, linking each result back
to the scheduler job, batch script, and scheduler log that produced it:

## Common Early Failures

- **No overlapping IDs across tables**: check that `id` has the same
  coding in `trial_data`, `run_data`, and `subject_data`. The pipeline
  coerces `id` to character, but it cannot fix inconsistent IDs.
- **Duplicated subject rows**: `subject_data` must have at most one row
  per `id` and `session`.
- **Missing run files**: prefer explicit `run_nifti` paths and verify
  `file.exists(run_df$run_nifti)` before setup.
- **TR not provided**: provide either `tr = <seconds>` in
  [`setup_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/setup_glm_pipeline.md)
  or a numeric `tr` column in `run_data`.
- **Model specs not finalized**:
  [`run_glm_pipeline()`](https://uncdependlab.github.io/fmri.pipeline/reference/run_glm_pipeline.md)
  requires a valid `l1_model_set`. Build L1 models before submission.
- **Confound column mismatch**: if confound files have no header, set
  `confound_input_colnames`. If they use fMRIPrep-style missing values,
  set `na_strings` inside `confound_settings`.
- **Backend mismatch**: AFNI Level 3 currently expects
  `l3_input_mode: 3dlmer` and FSL-produced upstream inputs.

## Minimal End-to-End Skeleton

``` r

library(fmri.pipeline)

trial_df <- readr::read_csv("inputs/trials.csv")
run_df <- readr::read_csv("inputs/runs.csv")
subject_df <- readr::read_csv("inputs/subjects.csv")

stopifnot(all(file.exists(run_df$run_nifti)))

gpa <- setup_glm_pipeline(
  analysis_name = "task_glm",
  scheduler = "slurm",
  output_directory = "/proj/lab/analysis",
  trial_data = trial_df,
  run_data = run_df,
  subject_data = subject_df,
  tr = 0.9,
  drop_volumes = 2,
  n_expected_runs = 2,
  l1_models = NULL,
  l2_models = NULL,
  l3_models = NULL,
  glm_software = "fsl"
)

gpa <- build_l1_models(gpa, from_spec_file = "task_glm_spec.yaml")
gpa <- build_l2_models(gpa, from_spec_file = "task_glm_spec.yaml")
gpa <- build_l3_models(gpa, from_spec_file = "task_glm_spec.yaml")

run_glm_pipeline(
  gpa,
  l1_model_names = "task",
  l2_model_names = "run_average",
  l3_model_names = "group_mean"
)

diagnose_pipeline(gpa)
```

For a first real project, start with one L1 model, one L2 model, and one
intercept-only L3 model. Once that path submits and status checks are
clean, add scientific contrasts, covariates, and alternate backend
models.
