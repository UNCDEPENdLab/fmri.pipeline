\title{front-end function for taking a list of windowed time series by mask value, interpolating them onto a time grid,
and (optionally) averaging across voxels/units within a value to derive the mean interpolated time series}
\usage{
get_medusa_compression_score(
  fmri_obj,
  event = NULL,
  time_before = -3,
  time_after = 3,
  collide_before = NULL,
  collide_after = NULL,
  group_by = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fmri_obj}{an fmri_ts object containing a single run of data with corresponding events}

\item{event}{the event to which the fmri time series should be aligned (column in \code{fmri_obj$event_data})}

\item{time_before}{How many seconds before the \code{event} do we want data. Default: -3}

\item{time_after}{How many seconds after the \code{event} do we want data. Default: 3}

\item{collide_before}{An optional vector of column names in \code{trial_df} that set a boundary on the earliest
time point used in interpolation. This effectively truncates the time series for interpolation to a smaller window
than specified by \code{time_before}.}

\item{collide_after}{An optional vector of column names in \code{trial_df} that set a boundary on the latest
time point used in interpolation. This effectively truncates the time series for interpolation to a smaller window
than specified by \code{time_after}.}

\item{group_by}{return interpolated time series for each combination of group_by variables. Default is
to provide one interpolated time series per trial.}

\item{pad_before}{Number of seconds to include in the epoch time window before the event of interest. Interpolation
spans the window from \code{time_before} to \code{time_after}, but padding includes data points at the
boundary that can help to have sufficient data to interpolate early and late times within the epoch.}

\item{pad_after}{Number of seconds to include in the epoch time window after the event of interest.}

\item{output_resolution}{the sampling frequency (in seconds) of the interpolated data. Defaults to be
the same as \code{tr}.}
